# Step 1: Use a Node.js image to build the app
FROM node:lts-alpine as build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the Vite app
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Use Nginx to serve the static files
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the Vite build output to Nginx's default HTML directory
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the default Nginx port
EXPOSE 80

# Run Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
